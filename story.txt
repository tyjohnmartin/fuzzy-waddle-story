Once there was a boy from Maine named Steven. He loved Halloween and everything that came with it, from the trick-or-treating, to the costumes, to the parties and even the scary movies. What he loved most of all though was the chance to scare, whether it be tell some scary stories, or to freak out his local neighbors with some practical joke...

Until one Hallow's Eve, when he tried to pull a prank on the Old Man Haggerty's house at the end of the block.The decrepit building was a prime target. It was out of the way, and nobody cared much if it was defaced. He grabbed his mask, a dozen eggs, a 12 pack of toilet paper, and set ou tfor a night of shenanigans.
