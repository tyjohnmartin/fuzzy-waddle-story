Once there was a boy from Maine named Steven. He loved Halloween and everything that came with it, from the trick-or-treating, to the costumes, to the parties and even the scary movies. What he loved most of all though was the chance to scare, whether it be tell some scary stories, or to freak out his local neighbors with some practical joke...

Until one Hallow's Eve, when he tried to pull a prank on the Old Man Haggerty's house at the end of the block.The decrepit building was a prime target. It was out of the way, and nobody cared much if it was defaced. He grabbed his mask, a dozen eggs, a 12 pack of toilet paper, and set ou tfor a night of shenanigans.

As Steven approached the house, he was so excited that he was going to get to spend another Halloween messing with the old man. But little did he know that the old man was ready for him this time. For you see, Old Man Haggerty had grown weary of the young rascals messing with his house on Halloween. This year, he had amassed a stockpile of eggs of his own, and was just waiting for some unsuspecting kid to come prank his house.
